RATS_NEST
Rob Andy Take Stats - Nearly Every Stat Taken

Eventually this will be:
* db_output - make basic stats available
* db_input - upload basic stats from UltiAnalytics ouput
* rats_analysis - advanced analytics
* the_nest - the database and server backend that powers all this

This will be a web app done on Heroku, with Django as the framework

Commit to git repo - is mirrored to Heroku
- build / release phase - ## this needs clarification 
Publish on heroku
