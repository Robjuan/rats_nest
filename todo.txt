#######
THERE ARE NO RESTRICTIONS ON UPLOADING TO THE DATABASE
HENCE WE CANNOT DEPLOY TO HEROKU UNTIL AUTHENTICATION IS SETUP
#######

** Objectives:
MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT:
1. Build .csv upload capability ** DONE
2. Build .csv -> db parser
3. Build db output capability ** DONE

deploy specific - need to migrate on heroku end, then check db connection

refactor the upload out into it's own 'app' within the django project
>> currently sitting inside db_output

** Methods:
1. - upload_csv view w/ filestorage etc.
   > needs to call the parser after upload

2. build parser that will read .csv from storage
   > must execute database input commands 
   > this is very easy using django .save()

3. simple read view (eg current postgreSQL view


** Considerations:
object names in models should(?) be singular

should we define stuff like page titles in their templates?
> or should we pass it in views.py
