WORK OUT WHY IT ISN'T RUNNING REMOTELY


Overarching design concerns/thoughts:
# is it too linear? 
I am building a flow of screens to take the csv, add data as required,/
and end up with good datasets. 
Almost certainly exists potential for breakage if we access pages/
in the wrong order. Can I control access to make sure the linear flow I'm/
designing is the only possible route through the relevant pages?

** ENFORCE EXPECTED FLOW

parse() crashes if accessed before uploading new csv - only remotely ???

** Objective:
MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT:
1. Build .csv upload capability ** DONE
2. Build .csv -> db parser ** DONE
3. Build db output capability ** DONE

** STRESS TEST PARSER **

REMOTE ONLY ISSUES (usually storage/db related)
after uploading a new csv, fetching works
before that, no fetch works??
-- something to do with db sleeping?
