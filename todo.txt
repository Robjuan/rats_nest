parse() crashes if accessed before uploading new csv - only remotely ???

** Objective:
MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT:
1. Build .csv upload capability ** DONE
2. Build .csv -> db parser
3. Build db output capability ** DONE

Parser to be built.

REMOTE ONLY ISSUES (usually storage/db related)

before that, no fetch works??
