Overarching design concerns/thoughts:

# is it too linear? 
I am building a flow of screens to take the csv, add data as required,/
and end up with good datasets. 
Almost certainly exists potential for breakage if we access pages/
in the wrong order. Can I control access to make sure the linear flow I'm/
designing is the only possible route through the relevant pages?

# inconsistency on how we are moving from view to view
most often just a simple render, sometimes HttpResponse, sometimes redirect
- I think if we stay away from simple URL movement we should be ok




REMOTE ONLY ISSUES (usually storage/db related)
after uploading a new csv, fetching works
before that, no fetch works??
-- something to do with db sleeping?
