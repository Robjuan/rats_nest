CURRENTLY:

- Views/Templates/Pages
Pages with very simple (or zero) logic are in simple_views.
Pages with complex logic are in views, grouped into categories.
Currently each view has it's own template which it uses to display itself.
The template name matches the view function name.

Parse is about taking in csv, saving to database
Analysis is reading database doing maths


TARGETS:

Features:
- robust player/team validation
- combining/linking two UA games
- analysis packages across multiple teams/seasons
- control over who can view stats

To be discussed:
- user registration / end-user upload
- pulling straight from UA using API
- personal stats distinct from main database
- database protection
