# local version forked from https://github.com/dschep/django-xor-formfields @ 23/12/18
# super thankful for them for making xorformfields
# however it required a couple updates to be compatible with django 2.0
# and it doesn't appear it's being maintained anymore (someone else has done this fork too)
# i'm saving it locally because that'll mean i wont have to schlep through requirements

# DIFF TO REMOTE:
django.forms.util -> django.forms.utils
